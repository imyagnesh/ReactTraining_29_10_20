Given
function getAddress() {
  return {
    city: 'Salt Lake City',
    state: 'UT',
    zip: 84115,
    coords: {
      lat: 40.776608,
      long: -111.920485,
    },
  }
}

Solution Using destructuring, call `getAddress()` and create a 'city', 'state' and 'zip' variable.
const newAddress = {...getAddress(), city: 'Hyderabad', state: 'Telangana', zip: 500036}
console.log(newAddress)

Solution Using destructuring, call `getAddress()` and create an 'address' variable.
const newAddress = {...getAddress(), address: 'no new address'}
console.log(newAddress)

Solution Using destructuring, call `getAddress()` and pull the city, state and zip out, and alias them to c, s, z, respectively
const {city: newcity, state: newstate, zip: newzip} =  getAddress()
console.log(newcity)

Solution Using destructuring, call `getAddress()` and create `lat` and `long` variables.
const newAddress = {...getAddress(), lat: 34.44, long: 123.44}
console.log(newAddress)
